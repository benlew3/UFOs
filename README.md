# UFOs
## Overview of the analysis
Here we are generating a website where we are sifting through a dataset  in a dynamic filter for UFO sightings. We will be utilizing HTML and JavaScript in order to print out the various queries. 

### Purpose
We want to use JavaScript and HTML to search the data to find out when and where UFO's were seen and to see what the UFO's looked like and for how long. We will have a query of date, city, state, county and shape of the UFO that will sift through our data set. This will pull the information and display on a table and will allow for diving deeper.

## Results
On our website, we have set up easy navigation for our data. We have created filters on the left hand side that will allow people to search as in depth as they would like regarding UFO's. The filters: date, city, state, county and shape. When someone enters a criteria of filter, the list will auto update and populate the data onto the table when the user clicks return. Seen below (fig 1) we can see the an unfiltered table and on (fig 2) we can see when we search for Arizona (AR) which returns 3 sightings. In (fig 3) we can see that you can use multiple filters to query a search for deeper diving, which in this case we are using California and January 2, 2010 as filters.

## Summary
Using HTML and JS libraries can be useful in allowing for dynamic filtering on websites for loaded datasets. Being able to filter information in real time is useful for both creating websites as well as being able to sort through data for people doing research on various things. To make things more streamlined, in certain fields, we could of created an outline of range, ie, dates allowed to be used, or how to write in states (only to use abbreviations). Another addition that would be useful is a "no results found" that would let the user know that there is no data for the criterias that were searched. Finally for the shape, it would of been more condusive if we used a drop down menu that would allow for the user to pick from a list, rather than guessing what shapes are in the data set.

### Difficulties
A lot of the issues I came across were primarily typo issues and setting up the github pages.
